	</div>

	<div>
		<h4>Pre-Interview</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Research the company. Understand who you are applying to and their mission/culture!</li>
			<li>Prepare for common interview questions (such as a small blurb about yourself, your strengths and weaknesses, prior experiences, soft and technical skills, etc.)</li>
			<li>Prepare questions for the interviewer, you are interviewing them as much as they are interviewing you. (see below for example questions).</li>
			<li>Review all technical requirements listed in the job posting and refresh your knowledge of these requirements.</li>
			<li>Print a physical copy of your resume and take it with you to the interivew.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h4>During Interview:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Be energetic and enthusiastic (most interviewers will make up their mind on an applicant within 5 minutes and spend the rest of the interview confirming their first impression!)</li>
			<li>Think positive and Be Positive!</li>
			<li>Make your selling points clear (Why should they hire you? What do you bring to the company that could benefit them?)</li>
			<li>Towards the end of the interview, ask the interviewer whether there is anything about you, your background, or your resume that will need further clarification. Don't forget to ask this as this might be your last chance to erase any doubt the hiring manager may have about you.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h4>Post-Interview:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Reach out to the interviewer and thank them for the opportunity to interview.
				<ul>
					<li>If you think the position won't be a good fit or you don't want to pursue the opportunity any further, let them know! It saves everyone time and will be appreciated.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>If the interview did not go well, don't give up! You likely will not ace every interview.
				<ul>
					<li>If you know what went wrong, work on actively improving (such as technical skills or soft skills).</li>
					<li>If you don't know what went wrong, but suspect something did, reach out to the interviewer and ask them for feedback.</li>
					<li>Set up mock interviews with friends and family to practice your interview skills.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>

	<h3>In-Person Interviews</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>Arrive 10 to 15 minutes early (if you arrive earlier than that, do NOT check-in until about 15 minutes prior to your interview time.)</li>
		<li>Go by yourself (unless a caregiver is needed). It does not give a good impression if other people come with you. If you rely on other people for a ride, ask them to wait in a nearby coffeeshop, park, etc.</li>
		<li>Dress in Business Attire, Slacks and a nice top will do. No need for full-suits unless the company specifies one is to be worn. Do NOT wear flip flops, open-toed shoes, or tennis shoes; Don't wear shorts!.</li>
		<li>Ensure that your face, hair, and beard are clean and groomed. Meaning, wash your face, brush your teeth, comb your hair (and beard).</li>
		<li>Remove any facial piercings,even if the company allows this on employees. You don't want your appearance to be distracting for the wrong reasons.</li>
		<li>If you wear makeup, keep it natural, again, you don't want your appearance to distract from your interview.</li>
		<li>Turn off your cellphone! (Seriously, turn it off!)</li>
		<li>Be friendly to receptionists, clerks, and any other individuals you encounter, more often than not, they will report your interaction with them to the hiring manager! You don't want to give a negative impression before the interviewer has even met you.</li>
		<li>Shake hands firmly, but only if a hand is offered to you first.</li>
		<li>Bring copies of your resumes, keep them in a folder or portfolio so they don't crease or wrinkle.</li>
		<li>Bring Pen and Paper to take notes! You can refer back to your notes after the interview and when you follow up with the interviewer.</li>
		<li>As with all types of interviews, make sure you have a list of pre-written questions for your interviewers (check below for example questions).</li>
		<li>Prepare a list of references. Let your references know that they are references for you, so they can prepare as well.</li>
		<li>Bring along Breath mints or floss, this will allow you to feel confident, especially for interviews just after breakfast or lunch times.</li>
	</ul>

	</ul>

	<h3>Interview Follow-Up</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>As your interview concludes, thank your interviewer for taking the time to meet with you.</li>
		<li>Within 1 business day, reach out to your interviewer in writing and thank them for interviewing you, use this opportunity to reiterate why you would be a good fit for the company and that you are looking forward to hearing from them regarding the next steps.</li>
		<li>If you get turned down for the position (or don't hear anything for an extended period of time - 4 weeks or more), reach out to the interviewer and ask if they have any interview feedback for you. This is a perfect learning opportunity for you.</li>

Don't mention things that could be seen as negatives, such as watching TV or streams all day.</li>
		<li>Avoid mentioning personal information such as marital status, children, political or religious affiliations. While it shouldn't, it may work against you as a candidate.</li>
		<li>Don't list multiple, or vague strengths without supporting examples. Choose two or three qualities about yourself. Support each of these qualities with short, polished stories that can be supported with your experience.</li>
		<li>Don't summarize your resume word for word. Do however discuss high points that are relevant to the position.</li>
		<li>Don't rush into conversations regarding what you're looking for in the role or how the company can benefit you, save these topics for the final stages of the interview when they made it clear they want you as a candidate.</li>
